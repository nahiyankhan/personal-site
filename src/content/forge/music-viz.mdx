## About

An audio-reactive visualization built with WebGL shaders. The visualizer responds to music 
in real-time, analyzing different frequency bands to create dynamic visual effects.

## Technical Details

The visualization uses a multi-pass rendering pipeline inspired by Shadertoy:

- **Pass 1 (Geometry):** Generates audio-reactive shapes based on bass, mid, and high frequencies
- **Pass 2 (Dot Matrix):** Applies a stylized dot matrix effect to the geometry
- **Pass 3 (Post-FX):** Adds chromatic aberration, vignette, and camera shake effects

### Audio Analysis

The Web Audio API provides frequency data through an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), which is 
split into three bands:

- **Bass (0-10 bins):** Drives expanding circle rings
- **Mids (10-50 bins):** Controls mid-frequency circle patterns
- **Highs (50-100 bins):** Animates fractal patterns

### Color Theming

Each track has a unique color theme defined in HSV color space. The hue shifts dynamically 
based on audio intensity, creating a cohesive visual experience that matches the music's energy.

## Controls

- **Play/Pause:** Start or stop the music and visualization
- **Shuffle:** Switch to a random track from the playlist
- **Volume:** Click to show volume slider, double-click to mute/unmute
